# C64 myPLATester shield - PLA 906114-01
The myPLATester shield is a Arduino Mega shield , to test the C64 PLA 906114-01 or his clones like the GAL PAL.
It check all output vectors  via all Input Vectors and shows the result with a LED or serial output

Its based on the work from AC Lovell - ACs 8-Bit Zone
for more information look at his Video

This repository contains all eagle files, gerber file, BOM, schematics, a little adjusted Arduino source code for my shield hardware, based on ACs code

Depending on where the parts and pcbs are purchased, the price for the complete shield is around 20â‚¬ (2023), without Arduino Mega and power supply
I built this project for find a issue with the GAL PLA from https://www.freepascal.org/~daniel/c64pla/, but the problem was only a wrong programming failure of my site.
